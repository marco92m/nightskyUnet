+BINIMNet_2_0.zip, the Dataset for training and file for U-NEt model initialization and implementation in Keras/Tensorflow are provided together with test images.

Dataset contains 4 folders:
-Grayscale_512: 5300 real and simulated monochromatic .JPG squared images. Size 512 x 512.
-Binary_512: 5300 .JPG squared binarized images. Size 512 x 512.
-gray_test: 300 real and simulated monochromatic .JPG squared images. Size 512 x 512.
-Bina_test: 300 .JPG squared binarized images. Size 512 x 512.

First two folders are related to Training and Validation purposes. The last two folders are needed for tests.
